## Apply for accounts

### Google Earth Engine (GEE) account

Please visit:

- [Google Earth Engine signup](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/)

You may need to log out and back into your web browser as the preferred Google account to request permissions. This approval process can take days to weeks unfortunately.

### Twitter developer account

Please visit:

- [Twitter developer signup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)

I recieved an email for clarification and had the account approved and running by the end of the day.

## Install software

This workshop will require the following software installed on your machine:

- [R](http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

Please download the appropriate stable release for your operating system.

## Launch RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for editing text in the code editor, running commands in the R console, viewing defined objects in the workspace and past commands in the history, and viewing plots, files and help. Here's a layout of the panes in RStudio, each of which can have several tabs for alternate functionality:

Check out the Help > Cheatsheets > [RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).

## Fork and Clone the Github Repository

If you'd like to play with these materials directly and keep track of differences, please visit:

https://github.com/bbest/meds-demo

While signed into Github, [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) into your own writable user space so you can [clone it in RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html#clone-the-new-github-repository-to-your-computer-via-rstudio).

Then you can follow along in RStudio by evaluating the chunks of R code, while referencing this website:

## Install R Packages

Here's a bit of code to ensure you have all the necessary packages installed. Please copy and paste this code into your R Console.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# use librarian to load libraries, installing if needed
if (!require("librarian")) install.packages("librarian")
library("librarian")

pkgs <- c(
  # utility
  "here","glue",
  "readr","dplyr","tidyr","purrr","scales",
  "lubridate","stringr","units",
  # api
  "jsonlite",
  # plotting
  "ggplot2","plotly",
  # spatial
  "sf",
  # text
  "rtweet","tidytext","textdata",
  # tensorflow
  "tensorflow","keras")
shelf(pkgs)

# report on versions of software & packages
sessionInfo()
```

## Create Rmarkdown file

Rmarkdown is a dynamic document format that allows you to knit chunks of R code with formatted text (aka markdown). We recommend that you use this format for keeping a reproducible research document as you work through the lessons To get started, File > New File > Rmarkdown... and go with default HTML document and give any title you like (default "Untitled" or "test" or "First Rmd" is fine).

Check out the Help > Markdown Quick Reference and Help > Cheatsheets > [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).

Here's a 1 minute video on the awesomeness of Rmarkdown:
